## Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end data science solution for predicting loan approvals using structured data. It includes robust preprocessing, feature engineering, multiple model comparisons, and a clean, user-friendly Streamlit interface designed for real-time predictions.

## Features

### Feature Engineering
- **TotalIncome**: Applicant + Co-applicant income
- **DebtToIncomeRatio**: Loan burden measurement
- **LoanAmount_Category**: Binned loan size (Low/Medium/High)
- **Income_Category**: Binned income levels (Low/Medium/High)
- **Categorical Encoding**: Robust and consistent mappings

### Machine Learning Models
- **Support Vector Machine** (Linear Kernel)
- **Random Forest** (100 trees)
- **XGBoost** (Hyperparameter-tuned)
- **Model Selection** based on evaluation metrics

### Model Evaluation
- Confusion matrix
- ROC-AUC curve
- Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1)
- Cross-validation scores
- Feature importance visualizations

### Web Application
- Interactive prediction form
- Real-time predictions with probabilities
- Clean dark-themed UI using Streamlit
- Deployable on Streamlit Cloud or Heroku
